### RD_value_flat ###

This Python 3.5 script calculates RD values from single Raman spectra following the procedure from Grützner and Bureau (2024) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2024.122065 .

The spectra need to be in a flat file like .csv, .txt, or related formats (like .dat files from the Labspec software).

The Raman shift should be in cm-1. Currently, it does not work for nm. 
In the paper from Grützner and Bureau a 514.5 nm laser has been applied.

Version 1.1 allows to save the normalized data in a new .txt file.
